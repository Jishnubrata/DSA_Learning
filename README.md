# 🧠 DSA_Learning

This repository contains my structured journey through **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes solved problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank, along with notes, explanations, and categorized solutions in Java and other relevant languages.

## 📌 Project Purpose

To build a strong foundation in DSA by:
- Solving a wide range of problems (easy to hard)
- Organizing problems by topic and difficulty
- Writing clean and efficient code with comments
- Tracking personal progress in preparation for coding interviews and competitive programming


Each folder contains:
- ✅ Problem statement (sometimes via comment or link)
- 💡 Logic and approach
- 🔁 Optimized solutions with time/space complexity analysis

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Java (primary), occasional C++/Python
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Online Judges (LeetCode, HackerRank ,etc.)



## 💡 Key Features

- Well-commented code for better understanding
- Organized by topic for quick access
- Real interview-style questions and patterns
- Updated regularly

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jishnubrata/DSA_Learning.git
   ```
2. Explore the folders based on the DSA topic you're studying.

3. Run Java files using any Java IDE or terminal.
